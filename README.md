## Notice
- This is a personal project I created during undergrad, as my friends and I loved to eat at Buffalo Wild Wings. I've always loved saving money, and we found this sheet to be of immense benefit to us. 
- Initially, this was comprised of line charts, until I spoke with my friends father, a senior employee at Dell, who introduced me to heat maps. The graphs were revised to heatmaps shortly after this conversation.
- This is a less complex project compared to my other works. It was created for personal real-life application, rather than an exhibition of skill. As such, I encourage you to check out my other projects to see the full extent of my skills!
- However, if you love Buffalo Wild Wings, you'll love this project! All information is sourced from North Dakota menus and locations.

## Project Overview
- Source price information and deals/promotions from North Dakota Buffalo Wild Wings locations
- Organize all information each deal and promotion, exhibiting price points for different number of wings ordered
- Convert this information into an easy-to-digest heat map, showing the which days will be the cheapest to order wings (and fries), based off of how many you intend to order

---

## Data Prep
- Manually entered all menu and promotion prices, sourced from the physical restaurants
- Organized each promotion into a separate column, with rows representing the price per count of wings.
- In a separate sheet, create heatmaps based off of the best pricepoint to purchase wings based off of the amount ordered
